# Project Description
The project's goal was to create an interactive quiz game in the style of the popular TV game show, Who wants to be a millionaire?
Utalising HTML, CSS and Javascript the project both reads and writes to the DOM to create the interactive experience.

# User Experience
## Primary Goal



# Creation Process
 
## 1. Strategy
* The game need to be simple and intuative as the users may not nessisarily tech savy.
* The game must track the score of the user so as to return feed back on their performance.
* The website requires a responsive design so that it can be used on a variety of devices.

## 2. Scope
* The webpage consists only of those elements used in the game with minimal additional content. 
* The website utilises the bootstrap framework to create a responsive site.
* The choice to use the well know brand of Who wants to be a millionaire ensures users who are familour with
it will immediately understand the concept of the game.

## 3. Structure
* The game follows a simple stucture with the score tracker, logo and life lines positioned at the top of the view windown and 
the quiz questions and answers places at the bottom of the view window.

## Typography
The fronts for this project were taken from https://www.cdnfonts.com/ . 
 * Shameimaru-sans was chosen for all headers in the project for its elegant and minimalist look. This suited the subtle and elegant     design for the project.

 * Montserrat was chosen for the paragraph elements as it contrasted well with Shameimaru-sans and remained easily readable at smaller
 sizes.
